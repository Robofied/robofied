### What is Robofied?
Robofied is a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence platform based in Gurugram,Haryana working towards democratizing safe artificial intelligence towards a common goal of Singularity. At Robofied, we are doing research in speech, natural language, and machine learning. We develop open-source solutions for developers which empowers them so that they can make better products for the world. We educate people about Artificial Intelligence, its scope and impact via resources and tutorials.

We discuss foundations, state-of-the-art bleeding-edge techniques, and resources!

### Our Story
We’re a team of Research Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, AI experts and consultants. We use our technologies and expertise for benefitting common masses and to empower the nextgen developers round the globe in order to solve critical challenges persisting in the way our goal towards Singularity.
Our AI capabilities range from Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Science, Natural Language Processing and Text based Analysis, Speech driven Applications, Computer Vision and Process Automation. Our work exists in industry verticals such as Fintech, Healthcare, Marketing & Sales, Cybersecurity etc.

### Our Mission
Robofied’s mission is to build secure & ethical AI products which can educate people about Artificial Intelligence, its scope and impact via resources and tutorials, to make the world a better place. We will attempt to directly build products that can empower humanity and next-gen developers, but we will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work assists others to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit ourselves to the following principles:

We commit to use our research and developments to ensure that it is used for welfare of the masses and to avoid any such use which is unethical, harms humanity and raises questions on the disproportionate power of such advanced products & systems. 

Our primary duty is to serve humanity for which we anticipate that we will have to build products which are minimally influenced by our stakeholders and would require us to keep conflicts of interests among our colleagues and clients to a bare minimum.
We are committed to doing the research & development into our products and services in an ethical manner to build an environment which motivates adoption of such practices across the AI community.

We are concerned about Speech & Natural Language enabled products and their plausible implications on the society, but would not hesitate from assisting a project which is aligned with our goal of singularity while keeping safety and ethics in regard.
To be effective at tackling the impact of speech & natural language enabled  products and services, Robofied must be on the edge when it comes to state-of-the-art research and techniques.

We believe that Robofied will have impact in other noble sectors of the society such as healthcare, fintech, cybersecurity, law and social media, and we will strive to leave a mark of impact in these domains by solving those critical problems which are aligned with our mission and expertise.
We will fervently collaborate with other research labs, organizations and policy-making institutions; we wish to create a global community of researchers, developers, students and masses to address the challenges lying in the path of AI embedded products and services to serve society.

We are committed to sharing our research & developments with the world for the sake of lucidity in the form of published research, open source tools and frameworks, web platforms. But we expect that safety and security concerns may hinder us to do that often in future and will lead us to reduce our traditional ways in order to establish a framework for safe, secure and standard research in Artificial Intelligence and its usage in products.
